            <h3>My work expeirence so far</h3>
            <p>
                As someone who was forced to stay home during the pandemic lockdown, I took the opportunity to explore new interests and discovered web development. With the help of my uncle, I began learning Python 3 through Codecademy, setting and achieving study goals to stay motivated. Throughout my learning process, I encountered many challenges, but I pushed through them by seeking out resources and reminding myself of the military adage, "What you put in is what you get out."
                </p>
            <p>As I delved further into programming, I found that front-end development particularly captured my interest. Seeing my code come to life in the workspace with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript was truly gratifying. After earning certificates in each language, I realized there was still much to learn, so I enrolled in the front-end-engineer career path on Codecademy. This program provides a comprehensive refresher on the basics while also introducing new concepts such as git and git hub, React, and Redux.</p>
            <p>Looking ahead, I plan to continue gaining experience by working on different projects that challenge me to become more proficient in my craft. I am excited to build upon the strong foundation I've established and to explore new opportunities in the dynamic field of web development.

            <h3>My personal life.</h3>
            <p>I was born in Gaza, Palestine, and my family moved to the United States when I was around three years old. We settled in Florida, where I spent most of my childhood and teenage years. After finishing high school, I wasn't quite sure what career path to pursue, and I was feeling a bit lost.

                That's when my father suggested I speak with an Army National Guard recruiter. I decided to take the plunge and signed a six-year contract, completing basic training and Advanced Individual Training in Oklahoma. After returning home for a few months, I made the bold decision to switch my army unit and move to southern California at the age of 19.
                
                That's where I met my current wife, who helped me a lot during the transition from Florida to California. I worked full-time and attended school full-time, taking general education classes without any clear idea of what I wanted to major in. I was considering medicine, but nothing felt quite right.
                </p>
                <p>
                Then, the pandemic hit, and suddenly, I had plenty of time to think about my future. It was during this time that my uncle, who I view as a mentor, suggested I explore programming by introducing me to Python. I found myself hooked, and after learning the basics, I knew that this was the field I wanted to pursue.
                
                Today, I'm proud to say that I'm a skilled programmer, and I've found a career that I truly love. Though it took a bit of wandering and soul-searching to get here, I'm grateful for the path that led me to where I am today.
