            <h3>My work expeirence so far</h3>
            <p>
                I started my web development journey during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. It was a time in my life when I was forced to stay home and really think about what I wanted to do in life. Seeing as how every non-essential business was forced to close to prevent the spread of a highly contagious virus. The idea of programming came from a close uncle who has become the main mentorship figure in my life. He explained how he had recently picked up programming as a hobby. He recommended I start out with Python 3 as an introductory language. This seemed like the perfect opportunity to do so. I started with courses on Codecademy, which he had recommended as a good platform to learn and get certified, as Codecademy is used by many big tech companies such as NASA, IBM, and many more.
                </p>
            <p>When I first started coding I set goals for myself using the Codecademy platform. I aimed to study Python 3, 4 hours a day, 5 days a week. I kept myself accountable and was able to achieve a 7-week long streak without missing a single day. I was motivated by a saying that was taught to me in the military. "What you put in is what you get out.". At the time this was in reference to the effort I should place into our physical training exercise. This saying really resonated with me because it was just such a true and simple statement. This really is what everything boils down to. This really pushes me to stay honest with myself and put in the best and most effort I could into things so that when I face challenges, I am ready to overcome them. There were many insistences where I was stuck on a concept or project during my courses. I felt the need to want to give up and try another day. However, I know this would not give me the results I needed. If I wanted to achieve the goal of being a professional programmer  I would have to put in a great amount of effort and keep using every resource I can to better understand different concepts or finish projects.</p>
            <p>After I learned Python 3. I started to think about my next steps. During my journey, I learned about the different roles and functions of computer languages. I learned about the different roles front-end, back end and full-stack developers play. I felt front-end development had caught my attention the most. One thing I liked about the front end was seeing your code come to life in the workspace. Writing the content with HTML and designing and styling it with CSS seemed very enjoyable. I started the learn HTML 5 course on Codecademy and kept a steady pace of studying 5 days a week. I learned many new rules of HTML and syntax. Afterward, I continued on the path of front-end programming with CSS and lastly Javascript.
            </p>
            <p>Once I achieved those different certificates I thought I was done. I couldnâ€™t have been more wrong! There is so much to learn and build upon. I had played a strong foundation in learning the basics, but there was still plenty to build upon.</p>
            <p>I did some research on the different paths ahead of me. I decided to start the front-end-engineer career path on Codecademy. This takes what I know in HTML, CSS., and Javascript, and builds on that knowledge. I would get a refresher on those languages as well as work on new projects and quizzes. I will also learn things such as git and git hub, as well as React and Redux. This seemed like the perfect course to help me become one step closer to my goal of becoming a professional developer! Afterward, I plan on practicing and gaining experience from different projects that help challenge me to become more proficient at what I do.</p>

            <h3>My personal life.</h3>
            <p>I was born in Gaza, Palestine. My family moved to the United States when I was around 3 years old. We moved to Florida and I continued to live there until I was around 19 years old when I moved to California after. After high school, I was not sure what career I wanted to pursue. My father put me in contact with an Army National Guard recruiter. Next thing I know I'm being shipped off to basic training in Oklahoma. I ended up signing a six-year contract with the Army National Guard from 2014-2020. After I finished basic training and Advanced Individual Training I came back home for a couple of months.
            </p>
            <p>At the age of 19, I decided to move to southern California and switch my army unit. I met my current wife in Los Angeles and she helped me out a lot during my transition from Florida to California. I worked and went to school full-time for both responsibilities. I was not sure what I wanted to go to school for, but I was somewhat leaning toward medicine. In the meantime, I was taking my general education classes which were around 60 credits in total after two years. After I finished I was not sure what I wanted to major in, this is when the pandemic hit and I had plenty of time to think about what I wanted to do in life. It was during this time that I started learning how to program.
